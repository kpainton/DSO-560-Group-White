## Natrual Language Processing Movie Review Project

### Project Scope: 

As IMDB user-base continues to grow, the volume of user reviews and ratings are going to increase exponentially.  

With this large database and detailed scoring system, automating processes through NLP models can improve movie tagging and become a foundation for search recommendation systems.  

This can be accomplished through a sentiment model and multiclassification models using the latest deep learning architectures.   

These models can also deliver advanced insights into how sentiment and reviews can influence film performance.

Our goal is to deliver four business solutions to address the needs of the company and open new analysis opportunities that can be offered as services to production companies.  

### Project Solutions

Sentiment Analysis Model: Predicts the review sentiment as positive or negative <br>

Review Classification Model: Predicts the movie genre of a particular review <br>
